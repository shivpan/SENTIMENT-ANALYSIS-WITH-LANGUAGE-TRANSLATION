# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-WITH-LANGUAGE-TRANSLATION
The proposed system combines sentiment analysis and language translation using Google Translator API.Aim is to analyze sentiments in multilingual text, providing valuable insights.
Language Translation: Utilize a translation service or model to translate the input text into a common language for analysis (e.g., English).Preserve the original text and translated text for reference.
Sentiment Analysis: Apply sentiment analysis algorithms to the translated text to determine sentiment scores (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). Use pre-trained sentiment analysis models or custom models trained on multilingual data.
